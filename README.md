# Text juicer :tropical_drink:

This module extracts entities (juice :tropical_drink:) from a text string using Regex.

> Entities are: e-mail, phones, numbers, dates, money, national ID...

## Usage

Import Text Juicer and use it passing a text and the language it should use as a String or Array of Strings (it will iterate over them all).

If you want, you can select what "extractor" to use passing a third argument to the Text Juicer.

````
const textJuicer = require('text-juicer');

// Passing just text (Default -> language: 'pt-br', extractors: all)
const extracted1 = textJuicer.parseData('My text goes here');
// Selecting EN language
const extracted2 = textJuicer.parseData('My text goes here', 'en');
// Selecting 'pt-br' and 'email' extractor
const extracted3 = textJuicer.parseData('My text goes here', 'pt-br', 'email');
// Selecting lang: 'pt-br' and 'en' / extractors: 'email' and 'phone
const extracted4 = textJuicer.parseData('My text goes here', ['pt-br', 'en'], ['email', 'phone']);
````

What "juice" may you extract from your text?

#### EN

* E-mails
* Dates
* Money values
* Phone numbers
* Zip codes
* Numbers
* Codes (like protocol codes)

#### PT-BR

* E-mails
* Dates
* CPF
* CNPJ
* Money values
* Phone numbers
* CEP
* Numbers
* Codes (like protocol codes)

## Results

Each component might have it own way of returning data, but all of them follow this default structure:

````
{
  "language": {
    "entity 1": [
     { // First element found for this entity
      "start": Starting index in String,
      "end": Ending index in String,
      "match": Matched text,
      "data": Extracted Data
     },
     { // Second element found for this entity
      "start": Starting index in String,
      "end": Ending index in String,
      "match": Matched text,
      "data": Extracted Data
     }
    ],
   "entity 2": [ ... ]
  },
  "language 2": { ... }
}
````

Above are the particularities for each extractor.

#### Date

`reference`: date used as reference for parser (check Chrono documentation: https://github.com/wanasit/chrono).

`type`: if data is a single date (`plain`) or a range (`range`). If range, there will be an Array with `start` and `end` properties for the range.

````
"date": [
 {
  "reference": "2017-03-22T02:37:37.537Z",
  "start": 39,
  "end": 42,
  "match": "4-9",
  "type": "range",
  "data": {
   "start": "2017-03-21T07:00:00.000Z",
   "end": "2017-03-21T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
 }
]
````

#### Money

`currency`: currency of the value (`data`).

````
"money": [
 {
  "start": 16,
  "end": 32,
  "match": "US$ 10 e 5 cents",
  "currency": "US$",
  "data": 10.05
 }
]
````

#### Phone

`data.countryCode`: Phone's country code (default: +55 [Brazil]).

`data.areaCode`: Phone's area code.

`data.phone`: Phone number.

````
"phone": [
 {
  "start": 10,
  "end": 23,
  "match": "078 55015 680",
  "data": {
   "countryCode": "+55",
   "ddd": "07",
   "phone": "85501-5680"
  }
 }
]
````

#### Number

Numbers `data` is always given as an Array, since it might have a sequence of numbers.

````
"number": [
 {
  "start": 25,
  "end":41,
  "match": "seventy thousand 4532",
  "data": [
   70000,
   4532
  ]
 }
]
````

### Considerations

#### Numbers
Numbers are always extracted last and only on the text's "residue". This is because you may have money and dates in your text, and it shouldn't be mistaken by a "number value".

````
textJuicer.extractData('I spent $ 54,00 on this shirt, but I will use it only in 5 days', ['en']);

// Returns date and money, but no number
{
 "en": {
  "date": [
   {
    "reference": "2017-03-22T03:16:22.130Z",
    "start": 54,
    "end": 63,
    "match": "in 5 days",
    "type": "plain",
    "data": "2017-03-27T15:00:00.000Z"
   }
  ],
  "money": [
   {
    "start": 7,
    "end": 16,
    "match": " $ 54,00 ",
    "currency": "US$",
    "data": 5400
   }
  ]
 }
}
````

Another important thing about numbers is that you may get **written numbers**! *(Only in Brazilian Portuguese for now)*

````
juiceParser.extractData('meu numero da sorte Ã© cinquenta mil quinhentos e setenta e sete');

// Returns
{
 "pt-br": {
  "number": [
   {
    "start": 22,
    "end": 63,
    "match": "cinquenta mil quinhentos e setenta e sete",
    "data": [
     50577
    ]
   }
  ]
 }
}
````
